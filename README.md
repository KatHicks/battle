### Instructions

We worked through the challenges throughout the week in rotating pairs. Aim of the challenge was to create a basic online game called 'Battle' that satisfies the following user stories:

```
As two Players,
So we can play a personalised game of Battle,
We want to Start a fight by entering our Names and seeing them

As Player 1,
So I can see how close I am to winning
I want to see Player 2's Hit Points

As Player 1,
So I can win a game of Battle,
I want to attack Player 2, and I want to get a confirmation

As Player 1,
So I can start to win a game of Battle,
I want my attack to reduce Player 2's HP by 10

As two Players,
So we can continue our game of Battle,
We want to switch turns

As Player 1,
So I can see how close I am to losing,
I want to see my own hit points

As Player 1,
So I can lose a game of Battle,
I want Player 2 to attack me, and I want to get a confirmation

As Player 1,
So I can start to lose a game of Battle,
I want Player 2's attack to reduce my HP by 10

As a Player,
So I can Lose a game of Battle,
I want to see a 'Lose' message if I reach 0HP first
```

### Objectives

* Are you having fun?
* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?
* **Can you build a web app?**

### Using my application

* Download the source code using `$ git clone`
* Navigate into the root of the directory using `$ cd`
* Install all the dependencies by running the command `$ bundle` in the root directory
* Run the app locally by typing either `$ ruby app.rb` or `$ shotgun config.ru` in the command line
  * Note that shotgun should mean that the app does not need to be reloaded after changes to the code base

### Running the tests

* Within the root of the directory, run `$ rspec` to run the tests and see the results in the command line

### Dependencies

* Application written in **Ruby 2.3.3**
* Built using the **Sinatra** web framework
* Uses the **Shotgun** gem so that the app can reload changes to the code base when running locally
* Unit tests written in **RSpec**
* Feature tests written using **RSpec** and **Capybara**
